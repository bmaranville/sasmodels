The 1D scattering intensity is calculated in the following way (Guinier, 1955)

.. math::

    P(q) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V_\text{shell}} \left[
           \frac{3V_{\text{core}}({\rho_{\text{solvent}}
           - \rho_{\text{shell}})j_1(qR_{\text{core}})}}{qR_{\text{core}}}
           + \frac{3V_{\text{tot}}(\rho_{\text{shell}}
           - \rho_{\text{solvent}}) j_1(qR_{\text{tot}})}{qR_{\text{tot}}}
           \right]^2 + \text{background}


where scale is a scale factor equivalent to the volume fraction of shell
material if the data is on an absolute scale, $V_{shell}$ is the volume of the
shell, $V_{\text{cor}}$ is the volume of the core, $V_{\text{tot}}$ is the
total volume, $R_{\text{core}}$ is the radius of the core, $R_{\text{tot}}$ is
the outer radius of the shell, $\rho_{\text{solvent}}$ is the scattering length
density of the solvent (which is the same as for the core in this case),
$\rho_{\text{scale}}$ is the scattering length density of the shell, background
is a flat background level (due for example to incoherent scattering in the
case of neutrons), and $j_1$ is the spherical bessel function
$j_1 = (sin(x) - x cos(x))/ x^2$.

The functional form is identical to a "typical" core-shell structure, except
that the scattering is normalized by the volume that is contributing to the
scattering, namely the volume of the shell alone, the scattering length density
of the core is fixed the same as that of the solvent, the scale factor when the
data are on an absolute scale is equivalent to the volume fraction of material
in the shell rather than the entire core+shell sphere, and the parameterization
is done in terms of the core radius = $R_{\text{core}}$ and the shell
thickness = $R_{\text{tot}} - R_{\text{core}}$.

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as *P(q)* above, regardless of the
orientation of the *q* vector which is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}


NB: The outer most radius (= *radius* + *thickness*) is used as the effective
radius for *S(Q)* when *P(Q)* \* *S(Q)* is applied.

(w/200 data point). Polydispersity and instrumental resolution normally
will smear out most of the rapidly oscillating features.*
