This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for a spherical particle with a core-shell structure.
The form factor is normalized by the particle volume.

Definition
----------

The 1D scattering intensity is calculated in the following way (Guinier, 1955)

.. math::

    P(q) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V} F^2(q) + \text{background}

where

.. math::

    F^2(q)=\frac{3}{V_s}\left[V_c(\rho_c-\rho_s)\frac{\sin(qr_c)-qr_c\cos(qr_c)}{(qr_c)^3}+
    V_s(\rho_s-\rho_{solv})\frac{\sin(qr_s)-qr_s\cos(qr_s)}{(qr_s)^3}\right]

where $V_s$ is the volume of the outer shell, $V_c$ is
the volume of the core, $r_s$ is the radius of the shell, $r_c$ is the radius of the
core, $\rho_c$ is the scattering length density of the core, $\rho_s$ is the scattering length
density of the shell, $\rho_{solv}$ is the scattering length density of the solvent.

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as $P(q)$ above, regardless of the
orientation of the $q$ vector.

NB: The outer most radius (ie, = radius + thickness) is used as the
effective radius for $S(Q)$ when $P(Q) \cdot S(Q)$ is applied.

Validation
----------

Validation of our code was done by comparing the output of the 1D model to the output of
the software provided by NIST (Kline, 2006). Figure 1 shows a comparison of the output of
our model and the output of the NIST software.

    the output of the NIST SANS analysis software. The parameters were set to:
    *scale* = 1.0, *radius* = 60 , *contrast* = 1e-6 |Ang^-2|, and
    *background* = 0.001 |cm^-1|.
